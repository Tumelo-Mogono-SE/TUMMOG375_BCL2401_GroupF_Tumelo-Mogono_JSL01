# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

# Aim of the Project
* Using the script.js file,the aim is to complete the validateSyntax function to check if the input string starts with "pet_" and is followed by a combination of letters and numbers.
* If the input follows the correct syntax, set the result to "Valid Syntax." Otherwise, set it to "Invalid Syntax."

# Adding Logic
* Creating a variable with a regular expression which checks whether a string starts with "pet_" and has four digits which start with either "19" or "20" and two random number's followed by alphabets which start with uppercase and followed by random alphabetics.
* Using an if statement which checks if the input string matches the regular expression in the variable validator, if true it passes a valid syntax string to a variable already created (results). Else if it doesn't match it passes a invalid syntax string to the results variable.
* The results variable is then passed to an elements which contains a id called results which will display either of the strings from the if statement.

## Challenge 
Not alot of challenges, only had to learn regular expression from a few videos in order to be able to implement it. Thanks to w3schools and webdevsimplified youtube video. 

## Feedback
The project helped to push me to learn something new which not covered in LMS topic's. It allowed me to improve problem solving in tackling task's for programming.
